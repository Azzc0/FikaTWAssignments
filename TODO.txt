features:
[x] Do some more UI changes. Buttons are currently floating outside windows due to me being lazy.

[ ] Add a raid dropdown to make room for more templates per raid in the templates submenu.

[x] Add groups as assignees.

[x] Implement quickfill to replace some placeholder assignments.

[x] Add a next/previous template button. Functionality has been added with TWA:SwitchTemplate() Accepts next/previous

[ ] Make a fuBar plugin.

[ ] Make additional templates for various trash packs and a few more bosses.

bugs:
* full sync needs to broadcast which template to use

implement a cooldown/debounce for full syncs for like 5 seconds (to reduce traffic while doing a lot of invites)
  - you can pass a callback to SendAddonMessage to know when a sync completes. If more requests came in during last sync, sync again
