features:
Do some more UI changes. Buttons are currently floating outside windows due to me being lazy.

Add a raid dropdown to make room for more templates per raid in the templates submenu.

Add groups as assignees.

Implement quickfill to replace some placeholder assignments.

Add a next/previous template button.

Make a fuBar plugin.

bugs:
* full sync needs to broadcast which template to use

implement a cooldown/debounce for full syncs for like 5 seconds (to reduce traffic while doing a lot of invites)
  - you can pass a callback to SendAddonMessage to know when a sync completes. If more requests came in during last sync, sync again
